## <span id="about">About</span>
Welcome to the [PublishingLab](http://publishinglab.org), this section tells you a bit about who we are, who our interns are and who our partners are. You will also find an overview of what we do.

### <span id="whoarewe">Who are we</span>
The PublishingLab is an applied research lab in the field of hybrid publishing working at the intersection of publishing and digital technology, both in print and on screen. We are part of the Amsterdam Creative Industries Network (ACIN) and the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. The world of digital publishing has been growing steadily for several years. The arrival of tablets and smartphones has accelerated these developments, and today it is impossible to imagine a media landscape without e-books, newspaper apps, and digital magazines. Digitalization is turning the field upside down! This is where the PublishingLab comes in.

The PublishingLab is part of [ACIN](http://www.amsterdamcreativeindustries.com), the national talent, knowledge and business network for creative industry and digital technology. ACIN was founded by the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, the Amsterdam School of the Arts and Inholland University of Applied Sciences. ACIN currently hosts eleven other labs such as Art&Technology lab, Fashion&Technology lab, Gamelab, etc. PublishingLab is based in Benno Premselahuis, at the School of Design & Communication from the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. Students, teachers and researchers work together on applied research with the creative industries and the ICT sector. The results will be used in curriculum development and consulting the industry. Together with the [Institute of Network Cultures](http://networkcultures.org) (INC), PublishingLab is located on the Amstelcampus Amsterdam.

### <span id="whoourinternsare">Who our interns are</span>
PublishingLab works with students from different backgrounds, offering a wide range of opportunities to its students – from experimenting with digital publishing workflows to testing user interface design. We like to work with students who don’t give up easily; who like experimenting with text, typography, code, (moving) images and the opportunities that digital media provide. We work with students with design, hacking, writing and many other skills; the teams are multidisciplinary and selected to fit the needs of the project. We’re looking for motivated students who respond to opportunities and challenges intelligently, creatively and want to push the boundaries of hybrid publishing.

### <span id="whoourpartnersare">Who our partners are</span>
PublishingLab works with various partners, ranging from government institutions, Dutch SMEs, and large international corporations in the field of digital media and publishing. Our projects are always shaped in co-creation with our partners. Working with partners means the PublishingLab has a good network in Amsterdam's creative industries. Recent partners include De Persgroep Nederland, De Persgroep Digitaal, WeekbladpersGroep, UNStudio, Canon, Cinekid, Hogeschool Bibliotheek Amsterdam, Het Vlaams-Nederlands platform Laboratorium Actuele Kunstkritiek, Domein voor Kunstkritiek, rekto:verso, Archined, Piet Zwart Institute and many others.

### <span id="whatwedo">What We Do</span>
The PublishingLab conducts applied research by doing innovative experiments in the field of (digital) publishing. This includes research on the impact of developments on the branch as a whole, conducting small experiments in the field of EPUB3 (such as research/work on user interface design for collaborative online editing environments), research/work on conveying hybrid publishing concepts and work flows to a non-expert audience or experiments that aim to solve interesting design problems.


## <span id="showcases">Showcases</span>
The following showcases are developed in close collaboration between students and researchers from the PublishingLab and a partner from the creative industries.

### <span id="persgroep">Transforming Hit 'n' Run Millennials - De Persgroep (2016)</span>
<!-- title (year) -->

<p class="caption">Heatmap of testing the prototype.</p> 

<!--challenge / research question:-->
**Challenge**: How can De Persgroep build sustainable relationships with millennial readers that arrive to their articles through social media links?

<!--short alinea what the project is about-->
**Solution**: De Persgroep notices that many visits to their sites can be characterized as 'hit 'n' run'; the reader clicks on a link in their Facebook timeline or Twitter feed, reads 1 article while hardly being aware of the site it is part of, and leaves without any promise of returning. They want to find innovative ways of taking this first moment of interaction between a new reader and their brand further and build a sustainable relationship.

<!--connect research paper-->
Millennials grew up in a world of free online news; news sites sold ads to companies and readers payed with their attention and clicks instead of their money. With the advent of adblockers and overall disappointing ad effectiveness, this exchange isn't as profitable as it once was imagined to be. News sites the world over are struggling to keep afloat and engaging a new generation of readers seems essential in acchieving this. If millennials won't commit to one medium and pay a substantive subscription fee, what are innovative ways for news sites to make their product profitable and sustainable?

<!-- challenge / research question: -->
**Challenge**: How do we maximize efficiency and co-existence of the various formats (epub, print, HTML) for the INC 'Theory on Demand' series?

<!--short alinea what the project is about-->
**Solution**: The 'Theory on Demand' series is currently hosted on the INC website, which, unfortunately, is lacking a comprehensive searching tool or a filter to access the content of the publication. Although the current website has favorable esthetics, it functions as a static and non-navigable platform. What can an ideal (and effective) academic publication look like in the digital realm?

The project task involved adapting the already existing print and static content of the INC’s ‘Theory on Demand’ series onto the digital screens, more precisely, creating a fully digital version of the book, making use of the advantages and the possibilities of the web-page format. It can be seen as existing in the context of other innovative online publications such as [Open!](http://www.onlineopen.org/index.php) and [Fold](http://www.onlineopen.org/index.php).

### <span id="unstudio">Knowledge Matters, Interactive Book App - UNStudio (2015)
</span>
<!-- title (year) -->

<!-- challenge / research question: -->
**Challenge**: How can an interactive experience help a reader understand the architectural principles underpinning 25+ years of work and research in a way that print can’t?

<!-- short alinea what the project is about -->
**Solution**: Knowledge Matters web app is a digital extension of a printed book by UNStudio, that represents the Arnhem Station project as an interactive experience. It is divided in two ways of navigating through the content, based on time.
The 'fast' mode is a selection of material thought to be presented as highlights of the project. It is a linear narrative, presented within a chronological order, as a timeline. The 'slow mode' offers more detailed information on the project which fits the 'academic' type of user, who is searching for in-depth knowledge. A non-linear menu allows the user to make intuitive choices and construct his own story.

<!-- connect research paper -->
The goal of the interactive book ‘Knowledge Matters’ was to design an extension of a printed book: maybe a digital book? While analyzing and selecting material from the digital archive of UNStudio and becoming aware of its potential, we understood that a new approach had to be considered. Maybe not a mere translation between a printed matter and a digital one, but instead an exploration of the digital format in a way that would not be possible in the printed form.
We decided to create an app that would enhance the non-linear quality of the navigation and give priority to material in motion and interacte features. A combination of programming languages (HTML5, CSS and Javascript), together with graphic studies, shared motivation and enthusiasm made ‘Knowledge Matters’ a very unconventional book.

## <span id="SCREAM!">Design Approach - SCREAM!</span>
This section explains how we work: the process and design approach for completing your project. This method is borrowed from the [MediaLAB Amsterdam](http://medialabamsterdam.com/) SCREAM! Design Approach, which is a problem-solving method that helps create and evaluate solutions in response to challenges. 

Making teams effective and creative for complex challenges in a digital era. In an ideal design process there is a constant flow between researching and creating. SCREAM! facilitates this flow with a structured ‘common language’ for multidisciplinary design teams. MediaLAB Amsterdam introduces the SCREAM! approach that enables multidisciplinary teams (with members from various business units and background) to get started and structure their design and creative process. Teams work in short design sprints using the best elements of SCRUM [^SCRUM], supplemented by more design related rituals and artefacts that foster the creativity and human-centeredness along the way.  SCREAM! is therefore introduced in combination with the structured Design Method Toolkit, and the SCREAM app that will enable teams to plan and apply design methods in their projects, and create impactful solutions within short iterations. 

### <span id="designprocess">Design Process</span>
The MediaLAB Amsterdam design process helps create and evaluate solutions in response to challenges. In the process MediaLAB intends to evoke real curiosity in order to make students feel highly motivated to find answers and solutions. This involves lots of iterations, making, prototyping, going out on field studies and test each idea, concept or prototype with actual users.

### <span id="researchtranslatecreate">Research, Translate And Create</span>
At the start of every design challenge, and at the start of each new phase in the design process, research has a central role. Research provides plenty of insights; how people act/think/feel and who the intended users are, within the context of the challenge.
These insights are the key to a solution, but they have to be translated into actual design requirements: which are key for the optimal solution? This is something that can be decided based on the research, and implemented and tested by creating a prototype. A next step might be to research again into what you created by setting up a test with users. During the project there is a constant two-way flow: from research, translation to creation, and from creation, translation to research.

<p class="caption">Figure 1. MediaLAB Amsterdam Design Process, Research, Translate and Create phase (source: Manual MediaLAB Design Process 2014).</p>

### <span id="sprints">Design Sprints</span>
SCREAM! design sprints are the basic unit of progress. The design sprint is a "timeboxed" effort; that is, it is restricted to a specific duration. The design sprint process is similar to Sprints in an agile development cycle such as in SCRUM; they incorporate the same principles of learning early. In addition to the three main rituals in the agile Sprint (planning, review, retrospective), SCREAM! Sprints characterize themselves with the addition of the Translate session in the middle of the sprint and the focus on design methods during the Sprint Planning. The SCREAM! design sprints in the PublishingLab programme have an average duration of three weeks. 

### <span id="rituals">Rituals</span>
At the MediaLAB we use specific ‘rituals’ during each sprint. Each sprint starts with an ideation and planning session, has a mid-sprint translation session, and ends with a sprint review meeting and retrospective. During a sprint, the team has daily stand up meetings.


<img class="noshadow bigdiagram" src="imgs/figure2.svg" />

<p class="caption">Figure 2. MediaLAB Amsterdam Design Process (source: Manual MediaLAB Design Process 2014).</p>

<span class="numeral">1</span> Daily Stand-Up Meetings

The daily standup meeting takes place at the same time and place of every working day. Held (first thing) in the morning, it helps set the context for the coming day's work. These standup meetings are strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes and all team members actually standup instead of sitting down. This keeps the discussion brisk but relevant.

The daily standup meeting is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues raised are taken offline and usually dealt with immediately after the meeting. During the daily standup, each team member answers the following three questions:eam member answers the following three questions:

1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What will you do today?
3. Are there any impediments in your way?

<span class="numeral">2</span> Ideation And Planning

Every sprint has an ‘ideation and planning’ session. In this session the creative process is triggered by the facilitation of a brainstorm and ideation session in which ideas are identified and quickly sketched.

The most promising ideas are placed in a hierarchy and it is decided which have potential to be taken along in this sprint. After this, tasks are identified, but more importantly the exact sprint goal (and duration) is defined.

Last but not least, in this session a plan board in combination with the Design Method Toolkit is used to identify which methods are going to be used and how they are going to be executed during the sprint.


<span class="numeral">3</span> Translate and Transfer

In the middle of the 3-week sprint, there is a scheduled ‘translate’ session in which your team and the project-related researchers come together to translate research insights and decide which things to act on in this sprint or the next. Each translation session and its outcomes are carefully documented. The documentation is very important for later use in the academic paper, but moreover, it provides the team with a clearer overview of why they made or have to make specific decisions in the design process.

<span class="numeral">4</span> Sprint Review

After the team has completed the planned deliverables for this sprint it is time for the ‘sprint review’. In this meeting, which is organized with all stakeholders present, decisions on progress and how to proceed are made, including next steps and possible needs and wishes. Specifically, the team will present the work they did during the sprint and will run through the sprint backlog together with stakeholders.

<span class="numeral">5</span> Sprint Retrospective

A ‘sprint retrospective’ is held at the very end of each sprint. This is a meeting to reflect on both the results and the processes with the team. It is meant to change, improve, or stick to the way they work and function as a team. 

### <span id="competences">Competences</span>

A key principle of SCREAM! is the integration of research and design in general and explicit and recurring stages of reflection in design processes. All events and rituals are positioned as drivers for reflection in design. Interdisciplinary teams following a structured design process to come up with a solution (intervention or ‘response’) for a design challenge (as specified by a close cooperation between industry and academia).

The short sprints, fixed rituals, sessions and deliverable moments improve motivation and enhance learning and transfer between the different phases of the design process (for individual & team). SCREAM! fosters an iterative approach, productivity, planning, decision-making, creativity, applied research and the self-directing character of a team.
The design methodology supports teams to develop and evolve collective design competences (‘navigation’ & ‘negotiation’).

The interdisciplinarity and cross-influences between ideas and practice increase the body of knowledge, skills and opportunities, resulting in higher levels of performance. Individuals within a team choose the role that fits their own expertise. Therefore, if the team manages to have a shared vision/goals, this will address the collaborative and reflective learning principles of MediaLAB Amsterdam.

In summary, the following behavioral capabilities and competences are strengthened by SCREAM!:

[Empathy & Autonomy](empathy_autonomy): team members will learn to empathize with others, both within the team and inside-out (with users, stakeholders). Additionally, team members should show proficiency in choosing an own route (autonomy) in a highly insecure environment. 
[Leadership & collaboration](leadership_collaboration): Team members will learn to take the lead at any given moment in a project and manage stakeholder expectations. Furthermore, they will learn how to choose the right balance between individual and collaborative (value of) work. 
[Negotiation & navigation](negotiation_navigation): Team members will learn to negotiate complex decisions within the team and with multiple stakeholders. They should also be able to adequately navigate complex relationships. 
[Articulation & Decision ](articulation_decision):Team members will learn to formulate and address appropriate and feasible goals within the project scope. They will also learn to decide on methods, approaches and strategy to achieve these goals. 
[Responsibility & Accountability](responsibility_accountability): Team members will learn to take responsibility for own work in relation to team agreements and project scope. Furthermore they will learn to take accountability for their own work and distinguish it from work of others. 
[Translate & Transfer](translate_transfer)</span>: Team members will learn to translate specific and applied research results into project-appropriate insights. They will also be learning to transfer those insights into business opportunities and a larger body of knowledge.

## <span id="programme">Program</span>
PublishingLab follows MediaLAB Amsterdam's combination of an iterative design cycle and a scrum process in order to foster both the creative process and enforce teams to work structured and goal oriented. The method has proven to be a powerful combination for the multidisciplinary design teams that work on projects in the lab- context thats been provided. 
In addition, students are immersed in a program of workshops, master classes, lectures, as well as support by the PublishingLab team. 

### <span id="workshops">Workshops, Masterclasses and Lectures</span>
During the semester we offer you several possiblities to expand your knowledge and experience via workshops, masterclasses and lectures.

#### <span id="scrumtraining">SCRUM</span>
To structure the collaborative process of your project, we use the Scrum method discussed above. By setting clearly defined goals and dividing roles and tasks between team members, the method allows for an iterative approach to challenges and breaks larger goals up into achievable parts. During this workshop you will familiarize with this way of working.

#### <span id="presentation">Pitch Training</span>
Working on a project for a client means that you have to present your research, findings, plans and advice to them in a professional manner. This training is designed to help you make well structured and convincing pitch.

#### <span id="publishing">Experimental Publishing</span>
Experimental approaches to publishing in the art and design fields can trigger the development of unexpected understandings of design flows. In this workshop we will explore the [Post-Digital Publishing Archive](http://p-dpa.net), an online archive that aims to collect, categorize, and connect experimental publishing projects. We will use its current structure as a sandbox for developing different forms of archiving through layout, new functionalities, and different literary approaches.

#### <span id="ideation">Frame Insights and Ideation</span>
In this workshop students recheck their understanding of the problem at hand. In order to generate good ideas it is vital to make them a good fit with their context. The workshop introduces several fast-paced and productive exercises that can be used to generate lots of ideas in a short time. Teams then try to cluster the ideas into potential solutions. The most important goals of the workshop are to have fun, open your mind, and change the way you look at the world.

#### <span id="ux">User Experience Design</span>
This workshop engages the teams in a hands-on 'design for experience' practice. By introducing a systematic approach to designing products that deliberately elicit predefined emotional responses, the workshop aims to facilitate a shift from an intuitive to a structured and manageable perspective on user experience in conceptual design processes.
Denying experiential and emotional impact in the design of new concepts is like denying they are designed for humans.

#### <span id="prototyping">Prototyping</span>
How do you test your concepts without spending a lot of time programming only to discover something doesn't work the way you expected it to? From quick paper prototyping to increasingly high fidelity techniques, this workshop will teach you more about different methods of prototyping and when and why they are useful.

#### <span id="git">GIT</span>
Git is a source code management system that allows collaborative work and version control. It is an important component of the Hybrid Publishing Toolkit and widely used by developers in a multitude of projects. In this workshop we'll go through the basics of using Git by starting a collaborative project on [GitHub](https://github.com). We'll use the command line and a graphical interface, so that you can experiment with both and choose your favorite.

#### <span id="HTML">HTML and CSS</span>
HTML and CSS are the foundation of design for the web. They are also core languages in EPUB development. While HTML is responsible for the structure of the document, CSS is in charge of how it looks. This workshop will take you a step further in your knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3.

#### <span id="javascript">Javascript</span>
Javascript, or simply JS, is responsible for the interaction in web pages. Understanding the DOM (Document Object Model), DOM events, variables, functions and how to use JS to add interaction to your pages is what this workshop is all about.

#### <span id="inspector">Inspector</span>
The page inspector is a handy tool available in modern web browsers. It helps us examine HTML, CSS and JS and allows us to edit and debug our code - all in the browser and with instantly viewable results!

## <span id="lab">Lab: How To</span>
This section is about how to conduct yourself in the lab, how to work in a team, and how to best present your work.

### <span id="teamwork">Multidisciplinary And Multicultural Team Work</span>
At the PublishingLab you will work in a team of people with different skill sets and from different educational and cultural backgrounds. These differences can have an impact on how a team works together. Working in a team with a varied composition therefore requires a special attitude, both professionally and socially. Here are some things you should take into account.

### <span id="language">Language</span>
Multidisciplinary and multicultural teams are great for creative processes. However, when people who work together have different languages, this can be an obstacle to success. Speaking in your mother tongue is very different from speaking in a second or third language. So please consider your words carefully; issues of differing interpretations may arise, as well as cultural differences, especially when the English is not the first language of either of you. Be proactive to overcome these differences: use visuals, write down your ideas, sketch. Make sure you understand each other.

### <span id="communication">Styles of Communication</span>
Methods of communication that are normal for one group of people may appear ineffective or inappropriate to another group. A person from a culture in which loud voices and interruptions are not seen as aggressive may intimidate someone from a culture that teaches more reserved modes of expression. Learning about the cultures of your team members before you start working with them can help you understand their methods of communication.

### <span id="conflict">In Case Of Conflict</span>
When conflict does occur within a team, members from different backgrounds may react to the situation in dramatically different ways. Some people will repress their reactions to an insult, while others will fight back. These reactions are based on individual personality to some extent but are also conditioned by a person’s background. Resolving conflict requires:

* listening to the other person/people calmly
* an understanding of everyone’s view of what caused the conflict
* being open and respectful to each other’s background

You can ask your coach to mediate if you feel your attempts at solving the conflict are not working.

### <span id="presenting">Presenting Your Work</span>
At the end of the design process you will have the opportunity to share what you created with the world. We use our website as a communication portal for all our projects, but you will also present your results to the creative industries during a final event.

### <span id="blog">Blog</span>
One of the PublishingLab’s most important communication channels is its blog. Here, project teams keep followers and friends updated on the latest developments and insights in their projects or in related fields. As a team we trust you are just as proud of your work as we are, and just as keen to share its news on a regular basis. In the first week you will learn how our blog works and how you can best communicate and promote your team’s work there. You will be expected to write a blog post at least twice a month during your internship.

### <span id="documentation">Sharing, Working and Documentation</span>
To work together efficiently you’ll need tools to collaborate on projects, share documents and calendars, and communicate. There are huge numbers of digital tools available to help you with this: use them! The right tools will put the most relevant information within easy reach. See the tools section on our website for inspiration.


## <span id="resources">Resources</span>
These links, videos, books and tools will help prepare you for your role at the PublishingLab. Start by getting familiar with the Hybrid Publishing Toolkit.

Required Reading

### <span id="HPW">Hybrid Publishing Toolkit</span>
We use the Hybrid Publishing Toolkit (and variations on it) to produce EPUBs, websites and printed publications. If you haven’t already read it, be sure to read it while you’re here. It explains the Hybrid Publishing Workflow, and the context of our work in the PublishingLab.

![](imgs/0419-HVA_DPT_from_print_to_ebooks_OS_epub.png)

This Toolkit is meant for everyone working in art and design publishing. No specific expertise of digital or traditional publishing technology is required. The Toolkit provides hands-on practical advice and tools, focusing on working solutions for low-budget, small-edition publishing. Everything in the Hybrid Publishing Toolkit is based on real-world projects with art and design publishers. Editorial scenarios include art and design catalogues and periodicals, research publications, and artists’/designer’s books.

Download *From Print to Ebooks* [here](http://www.publishinglab.nl/blog/publication/from-print-to-ebooks-a-hybrid-publishing-toolkit-for-the-arts/).

### <span id="howto">How To</span>
Over the last two years we have improved our workflow. In our *[PublishingLab: How-to](http://publishinglab.nl/howto/?How-toHybridPublishing)* one can read the easy, step-by-step introductions to a specific field within digital publishing.
This how-to shows you how to create an epub using the Hybrid Publishing Workflow for creating multiple publications from one source file (including eBooks as ePub3 files).
You will find instructions and a template for making an ePub3, use CSS styles to modify your layout, and learn about the pros & cons of a fixed layout ePub. Additionally, some other current options for digital publishing are discussed.

### <span id="sm">Sausage Machine</span>
The <a href="http://hpt.publishinglab.org/">Sausage Machine</a> is an experimental system meant to facilitate hybrid text production. It builds upon the Hybrid Publishing Toolkit – an effort by a number of researchers and practitioners engaged in various forms of contemporary cross-media publishing. The Sausage Machine has been designed and programmed by Gottfried Haider during his employment at PublishingLab.

### <span id="UX">UX Principles</span>
Everything has a user experience (UX). The goal of a UX designer is to make effective design for users, which is central to our work. UX research starts with the aim of understanding the user and the client goals, developing ideas to solve the users’ needs, and then building and testing the solutions created in the real world (or lab environment).

## <span id="practicalinfo">Practical Info</span>

Answers to your questions and steps to help you set yourself up for your internship.

#### HvA ID + Card
You will need a HvA ID card which functions as an office key, print and coffee machine card and ID card to borrow equipment. To get this card, you will be sent a HvA ID and password at your personal email as soon as your documents are received and processed. The HvA ID consists of the first few letters of your last name and the first letter of your first name, e.g.: John Doe becomes doej. You need this ID to get your card and thus to set everything else up, so keep an eye out for this email. Once you have your ID, follow these steps to get your card:

* Go to [mijnhvapas.nl](http://mijnhvapas.nl)
* Upload your picture (make sure to choose an *employee* card)
* After a few days you will receive a mail on your HvA mail, which is accessible through webmail.hva.nl (sign in with HvA ID and password). The email tells you that your card is ready (pick up point might be in another building).
* After you have picked up your card, you need to activate it (at the service point on level 2, Benno Premsela Huis) to get access to printer and the office.

If there is a problem or delay, you can check with staff on level 2 of the Benno Premselahuis (BPH).

#### How to print
You need your ID card to print. Set up the printer to your laptop by following instructions on the HvA [site](https://hva-en.cbs.canon.nl/wat_doen_wij/over-het-nieuwe-printen/medewerker.html).

##### Here is your quick start

1. First log in on [overhetnieuweprinten.nl](https://hva.mijnnieuweprinten.nl/Login/Login) with your HvA ID and password. By doing this, your account is set-up on the printers. This may take up to 15 minutes.
2. To ensure that you have the right settings on your computer, go to [overhetnieuweprinten.nl](https://hva.mijnnieuweprinten.nl/Login/Login) an hit the the tab ‘PRINT’ > ‘Drivers and Instructions’
3. Register your HvA-card on the printer once. You can do this as follows: put your HvA-card on the cardreader of the printer until you hear a ‘beep’
4. Enter your HvA-ID without @hva.nl (for example doej) and your password on the touchscreen of the printer. *(The touchscreen appears when you press the white input field)*
5. You are now ready to print!

#### Facilities
The PublishingLab office is located within the Hogeschool van Amsterdam Location: Benno Premselahuis (BPH), Rhijnspoorplein 1, 1091 GC Amsterdam

#### Internet access
You can access the internet via eduroam if you are already a student. Otherwise, ask your coach to set up a guest account. Once you have your HvA ID & password you can login to the eduroam or HvA wifi.

#### Claiming expenses
Read your contract and discuss with your manager to see if you are able to be reimbursed for travel costs. You need to have agreed on the possibilities of reimbursement with the project coach or manager before you make a purchase. You need the project number and to fill in a Declaration form/ Declaratie- en Voorschotformulier .xlsx document. Print the form with the original receipt attached (photocopies are not accepted) and put it on your manager’s desk to sign off. You will usually be reimbursed within the month, make sure your declaration is with the service desk by the 15th of the month. Be aware: it takes a few days by internal mail to reach the accounts desk. Call 020 595 2700 for declaration queries – if you tell them your employee number, they can track your payment.

#### Illness
In the event of illness, please contact your coach before 9:30am by email or sms.

#### Holidays
You can request a day off with your coach. Of course you will have to inform your team too. One-day requests: a week in advance. More than one day? At least 3 weeks in advance. Be aware that your requests may or may not be granted, depending on project needs. If you work 4 days a week, you get 4 days holiday total + the official HvA holidays (recess marked on HvA calendar in May, Summer & over Christmas).

#### Work Hours
