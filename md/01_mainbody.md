##<span id="about"></span>ABOUT
Welcome to [PublishingLab] (http://publishinglab.org), this section tells you a bit about who we are, who our interns are and who our partners are. You can also  nd an overview of what we do.

###<span id="whoarewe"></span>WHOW ARE WE
The PublishingLab is an applied research lab in the field of hybrid publishing working at the intersection of publishing and digital technology, both in print and digitally. We are part of ACIN, Create-IT and the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.The world of digital publishing has been growing steadily for several years. The arrival of tablets and smartphones has ac- celerated the developments, and today it is impossible to imagine a media landscape without e-books, newspaper apps, and digital magazines. Digitalization is turning the  eld upside down! This is where the PublishingLab comes in. 

The PublishingLab is part of the [Amsterdam Creative Industries Network](http://www.amsterdamcreativeindustries.com). The Amsterdam Creative Industries Network (ACIN) is the Dutch national talent, knowledge and business network for creative industry and digital technology. ACIN was founded by the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, the Amsterdam School of the Arts and Inholland University of Applied Sciences. ACIN currently hosts eleven other labs such as Art&Technology lab, Fashion&Technology lab, Gamelab, etc. 
Publishing is based in Benno Premselahuis, at the School of Design & Communication from the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. Students, teachers and researchers work together on applied research with the creative industries and the ICT sector. The results will be used in curriculum development and for consulting the industry. Together with the [Institute of Network Cultures] (http://networkcultures.org), PublishingLab is located in the center of the Amstel Campus Amsterdam.

###<span id="whoourinternsare"></span>WHO OUR INTERS ARE
PublishingLab works with students from di erent backgrounds, offering a range of opportunities to its students – from experimenting with digital publishing work ows to testing user interface design. We like to work with students who don’t give up easily; who like experimenting with text, typography, code, (moving) images and the opportunities that digital media provide. We work with students with design, hacking, writing and many other skills; the teams are multidisciplinary and selected to  t the needs of the project. We’re looking for motivated people who respond to opportunities and challenges intelligently, creatively and want to push the boundaries of hybrid publishing.
###<span id="whoourpartnersare"></span>WHO OUR PARTNERS ARE
PublishingLab works with various partners, ranging from government institutions, Dutch SMEs, and large international corporations in the  eld of digital media and publishing.Our projects are always shaped in co-creation with our partners. During the projects the PublishingLab brings in a network of Amsterdam’s creative industries. Recent partners have included Persgroep Nederland, Persgroep Digitaal, WeekbladpersGroep, UNStudio, Canon, Cinekid, Hogeschool Bibliotheek Amsterdam, Het Vlaams-Nederlands platform Laboratorium Actuele Kunstkritiek, Domein voor Kunstkritiek, rekto:verso, Archined, Piet Zwart Institute and many others.

<!--maybe add some queotes from partners-->
###<span id="whatwedo"></span>WHAT WE DO
<!--underneath section needs to be rephrased -->
PublishingLab activities are directed towards the following three groups: 

1. makers (authors, designers);2. intermediaries (publishers);3. end users (readers / students).
The PublishingLab conducts applied research by doing innovative experiments in the  eld of (digital) publishing. This includes research on the impact of developments on the branch as a whole, conducting small experiments in the  eld of EPUB3 (such as research/work on user interfaces for collaborative online editing environments), research/work on conveying hybrid publishing concepts and work ows to a non-expert audience or experiments with the aim of solving interesting design problems.

##<span id="lab"></span>LAB: HOW TO
This section is about how to conduct yourself in the lab, how to work in the team, and how to present your work.###<span id="teamwork"></span>MULTIDISCIPLINARY AND MULTICULTURAL TEAMWORKAt PublishingLab you will work in a team of people with different skill sets and from different educational and cultural backgrounds. These differences can have an impact on how a team works together. Working in a team with a varied composition therefore requires a special attitude, both professionally and socially. Here are some things you should take into account.###<span id="language"></span>LANGUAGEMultidisciplinary and intercultural teams are great for creative processes. However, when people who work together have different languages, this can be an obstacle to success. Speaking in your mother tongue is very different from speaking in a second or third language. So please consider your words carefully; there are issues of interpretation, but also of cultural differences, especially when the spoken language is not the  rst language for either of you. Use visuals, write down your ideas, sketch. Make sure you understand each other.
###<span id="communication"></span>COMMUNICATION STYLESMethods of communication that are normal for one group of people may appear ineffective or inappropriate to another group. A person from a culture in which loud voices and interruptions are not seen as aggressive may intimidate someone from a culture that teaches more reserved modes of expression. Learning in advance about the cultures of your team members before you start working with them can help you understand their methods of communication.###<span id="hierarchy"></span>HIERARCHYThe importance of authority varies greatly between cultures. Some groups give great respect to people in positions of authority, while people from other cultures are perfectly willing to question an authority  gure if they see them doing something wrong. Authority is based on di erent criteria in di erent cultures.###<span id="conflict"></span>CONFLICTWhen con ict does occur within a team, members from di erent backgrounds may react to it in dramatically di erent ways. Some people will repress their reactions to an insult, while others will  ght back. These reactions are based on individual personality to some extent but are also conditioned by a person’s background.Resolving con ict requires:
* listening to the other person(s) calmly* an understanding of everyone’s view of what caused the con ict* being open and respectful to each other’s backgroundYou can ask your coach to mediate if you feel your attempts are not working.
###<span id="presenting"></span>PRESENTING YOUR WORKAt the end of the design process you will have the opportunity to share with the world what you have created. We use the website as a communication portal for all our projects, but you will also have the opportunity to present your results to the creative industry during a  nal event.

###<span id="blog"></span>BLOGOne of the PublishingLab’s most important communication channels is its blog. Here, project teams keep followers and friends updated on the latest developments and insights in their projects or in related  elds. As a team we trust you are just as proud as we are of our work, and just as keen to share its news on a regular basis. In the  rst week you will learn how our blog works and how you can best communicate and promote your team’s work there. You will be expected to write a blog post at least twice a month during your internship.
###<span id="documentation"></span>SHARING, WORKING AND DOCUMENTATIONTo work together e ciently you’ll need tools to collaborate on projects, share documents and calendars, and commu- nicate. There are huge numbers of digital tools to help you with this: use them! The right tools will put the most relevant information within easy reach.See the tools section on our website for inspiration.


##<span id="process"></span>PROCESSThis section explains how we work: the process and design methods for completing your project.One of the methods we use, is the MediaLAB Amsterdam design process <!--insert link to design process-->, which is a problem-solving method that helps create and evaluate solutions in response to challenges. In this process one tries to evoke real curiosity in order to make teams feel highly motivated to  nd answers and solutions. This involves lots of iterations, making, prototyping, going out on field studies and testing each idea, concept or prototype with actual users.![](imgs/figure1.png) 
<!--image of bad quality, but gives an idea of what is desired. change icons.-->
Figure 1. MediaLAB Amsterdam Design Process, Research, Translate and Create phase (source Manual MediaLAB Design Process 2014).###<span id="researchtranslatecreate"></span>RESEARCH, TRANSLATE AND CREATEAt the start of every design challenge, and afterwards, at the start of each new stage in the design process, research has a central role. Research provides plenty of insights; how people act/think/feel and who the intended users are, within the context of the challenge.
These insights are the key to a solution, but they have to be translated into actual design requirements: which are key for the optimal solution. This is something that can be decided on the basis of research, and implemented and tested by creating a prototype. A next step might be to research again into what you created by setting up a test with users. During the project there is a constant two-way flow: from research through translation to creation, and from creation through translation to research.###<span id="scrum"></span>SCRUMScrum is an iterative and incremental process for the design and development of products and services, and it has a very specific way of organizing a team. Tasks are achieved faster and with higher quality when using the Scrum Framework.This is possible because of the high self-motivation of the team, which chooses its own tasks and how to execute them. The project partner’s demands are iteratively prioritized and quickly actualized. The flow of the design process is embedded in a sprint-based schedule, ideally supported by Scrum roles, rituals, sessions and artifacts that support the process.###<span id="sprints"></span>SPRINTSA ‘sprint’ (or iteration) is the basic unit of development. The sprint is a ‘timeboxed’ effort; that is, it is restricted to a specific duration. The sprints in the PublishingLab have an average duration of three weeks. However, teams are free to  t and perform more sprints within those scheduled three weeks.###<span id="rituals"></span>RITUALSSpecific ‘rituals’ guide the development of a sprint. Each sprint starts with an ideation and planning session, has a mid-sprint translation / transfer session, and ends with a sprint review meeting and retrospective. During a sprint, the team has daily stand-up meetings.

Figure 2. MediaLAB Amsterdam Design Process (source Manual MediaLAB Design Process 2014).1. DAILY STAND-UP MEETINGS
The daily stand-up meeting takes place at the same time and place of every working day. The daily scrum meeting is held in the morning, as it helps set the context for the coming day’s work. These scrum meetings are strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes. This keeps the discussion brisk but relevant.
The daily stand-up meeting is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues raised are usually dealt with immediately after the meeting. During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:
	1. What did you do yesterday?	2. What will you do today?	3. Are there any barriers in your way?2. IDEATION AND PLANNINGEvery sprint has a ‘ideation and planning’ session. In this session the creative process is triggered by the facilitation of a brainstorm and ideation session in which ideas are identi ed and quickly sketched. The most promising ideas are placed in a hierarchy and it is decided which have potential to be taken along in the sprint. After this, tasks are identi ed, but more importantly the exact sprint goal (and duration) is defined. It is important to have a very clear goal, so that the team can break the e ort down into smaller-sized pieces that contribute to achieving that goal more smoothly,
3. TRANSLATE AND TRANSFERIn the middle of the 3-week sprint there is a scheduled ‘translate and transfer’ session in which your team and the project-related researchers come together to translate research insights and decide which things to act on in this sprint or the next (transfer).4. SPRINT REVIEWAfter the team has completed the planned deliverables for this sprint it is time for the ‘sprint review’. In this meeting, which is organized with all stakeholders present, decisions on progress and how to proceed are made, including next steps and possible needs and wishes. Specifically, the team will present the work they did during the sprint and will run through the sprint backlog together with stakeholders.5. SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE
A ‘sprint retrospective’ or ‘peer pitch’ is held at the very end of each sprint. This is a meeting to re ect on both the results and the processes with the team. It is meant to change, improve, or stick to the way they work and function as a team.

###<span id="UX"></span>UX PRINCIPLES
Everything has a user experience (UX). The goal of a UX designer is to make effective design for users, which is central to our work. UX research starts with the aim of understanding the user and the client goals, then develop- ing ideas to solve the users’ needs, and thereafter building and testing the solutions created in the real world (or lab environment).
