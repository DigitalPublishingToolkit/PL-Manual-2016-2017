##<span id="about">ABOUT</span>
Welcome to [PublishingLab] (http://publishinglab.org), this section tells you a bit about who we are, who our interns are and who our partners are. You can also  nd an overview of what we do.

###<span id="whoarewe">WHO ARE WE</span>
The PublishingLab is an applied research lab in the field of hybrid publishing working at the intersection of publishing and digital technology, both in print and digitally. We are part of ACIN, Create-IT and the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.The world of digital publishing has been growing steadily for several years. The arrival of tablets and smartphones has ac- celerated the developments, and today it is impossible to imagine a media landscape without e-books, newspaper apps, and digital magazines. Digitalization is turning the  eld upside down! This is where the PublishingLab comes in.

The PublishingLab is part of the [Amsterdam Creative Industries Network](http://www.amsterdamcreativeindustries.com). The Amsterdam Creative Industries Network (ACIN) is the Dutch national talent, knowledge and business network for creative industry and digital technology. ACIN was founded by the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, the Amsterdam School of the Arts and Inholland University of Applied Sciences. ACIN currently hosts eleven other labs such as Art&Technology lab, Fashion&Technology lab, Gamelab, etc.
Publishing is based in Benno Premselahuis, at the School of Design & Communication from the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. Students, teachers and researchers work together on applied research with the creative industries and the ICT sector. The results will be used in curriculum development and for consulting the industry. Together with the [Institute of Network Cultures] (http://networkcultures.org), PublishingLab is located in the center of the Amstel Campus Amsterdam.

###<span id="whoourinternsare">WHO OUR INTERNS ARE</span>
PublishingLab works with students from di erent backgrounds, offering a range of opportunities to its students – from experimenting with digital publishing work ows to testing user interface design. We like to work with students who don’t give up easily; who like experimenting with text, typography, code, (moving) images and the opportunities that digital media provide. We work with students with design, hacking, writing and many other skills; the teams are multidisciplinary and selected to  t the needs of the project. We’re looking for motivated people who respond to opportunities and challenges intelligently, creatively and want to push the boundaries of hybrid publishing.
###<span id="whoourpartnersare">WHO OUR PARTNERS ARE</span>
PublishingLab works with various partners, ranging from government institutions, Dutch SMEs, and large international corporations in the  eld of digital media and publishing.Our projects are always shaped in co-creation with our partners. During the projects the PublishingLab brings in a network of Amsterdam’s creative industries. Recent partners have included Persgroep Nederland, Persgroep Digitaal, WeekbladpersGroep, UNStudio, Canon, Cinekid, Hogeschool Bibliotheek Amsterdam, Het Vlaams-Nederlands platform Laboratorium Actuele Kunstkritiek, Domein voor Kunstkritiek, rekto:verso, Archined, Piet Zwart Institute and many others.

<!--maybe add some queotes from partners-->
###<span id="whatwedo">WHAT WE DO</span>
<!--underneath section needs to be rephrased -->
PublishingLab activities are directed towards the following three groups:

1. makers (authors, designers);2. intermediaries (publishers);3. end users (readers / students).
The PublishingLab conducts applied research by doing innovative experiments in the  eld of (digital) publishing. This includes research on the impact of developments on the branch as a whole, conducting small experiments in the  eld of EPUB3 (such as research/work on user interfaces for collaborative online editing environments), research/work on conveying hybrid publishing concepts and work ows to a non-expert audience or experiments with the aim of solving interesting design problems.

##<span id="lab">LAB: HOW TO</span>
This section is about how to conduct yourself in the lab, how to work in the team, and how to present your work.###<span id="teamwork">MULTIDISCIPLINARY AND MULTICULTURAL TEAMWORK</span>At PublishingLab you will work in a team of people with different skill sets and from different educational and cultural backgrounds. These differences can have an impact on how a team works together. Working in a team with a varied composition therefore requires a special attitude, both professionally and socially. Here are some things you should take into account.###<span id="language">LANGUAGE</span>Multidisciplinary and intercultural teams are great for creative processes. However, when people who work together have different languages, this can be an obstacle to success. Speaking in your mother tongue is very different from speaking in a second or third language. So please consider your words carefully; there are issues of interpretation, but also of cultural differences, especially when the spoken language is not the  rst language for either of you. Use visuals, write down your ideas, sketch. Make sure you understand each other.
###<span id="communication">COMMUNICATION STYLES</span>Methods of communication that are normal for one group of people may appear ineffective or inappropriate to another group. A person from a culture in which loud voices and interruptions are not seen as aggressive may intimidate someone from a culture that teaches more reserved modes of expression. Learning in advance about the cultures of your team members before you start working with them can help you understand their methods of communication.###<span id="hierarchy">HIERARCHY</span>The importance of authority varies greatly between cultures. Some groups give great respect to people in positions of authority, while people from other cultures are perfectly willing to question an authority  gure if they see them doing something wrong. Authority is based on di erent criteria in di erent cultures.###<span id="conflict">CONFLICT</span>When con ict does occur within a team, members from di erent backgrounds may react to it in dramatically di erent ways. Some people will repress their reactions to an insult, while others will  ght back. These reactions are based on individual personality to some extent but are also conditioned by a person’s background.Resolving con ict requires:
* listening to the other person(s) calmly* an understanding of everyone’s view of what caused the con ict* being open and respectful to each other’s backgroundYou can ask your coach to mediate if you feel your attempts are not working.
###<span id="presenting">PRESENTING YOUR WORK</span>At the end of the design process you will have the opportunity to share with the world what you have created. We use the website as a communication portal for all our projects, but you will also have the opportunity to present your results to the creative industry during a  nal event.

###<span id="blog">BLOG</span>One of the PublishingLab’s most important communication channels is its blog. Here, project teams keep followers and friends updated on the latest developments and insights in their projects or in related  elds. As a team we trust you are just as proud as we are of our work, and just as keen to share its news on a regular basis. In the  rst week you will learn how our blog works and how you can best communicate and promote your team’s work there. You will be expected to write a blog post at least twice a month during your internship.
###<span id="documentation">SHARING, WORKING AND DOCUMENTATION</span>To work together e ciently you’ll need tools to collaborate on projects, share documents and calendars, and commu- nicate. There are huge numbers of digital tools to help you with this: use them! The right tools will put the most relevant information within easy reach.See the tools section on our website for inspiration.


##<span id="process">PROCESS</span>This section explains how we work: the process and design methods for completing your project.One of the methods we use, is the MediaLAB Amsterdam design process <!--insert link to design process-->, which is a problem-solving method that helps create and evaluate solutions in response to challenges. In this process one tries to evoke real curiosity in order to make teams feel highly motivated to  nd answers and solutions. This involves lots of iterations, making, prototyping, going out on field studies and testing each idea, concept or prototype with actual users.![](imgs/figure1.png)
<!--image of bad quality, but gives an idea of what is desired. change icons.-->
Figure 1. MediaLAB Amsterdam Design Process, Research, Translate and Create phase (source Manual MediaLAB Design Process 2014).###<span id="researchtranslatecreate">RESEARCH, TRANSLATE AND CREATE</span>At the start of every design challenge, and afterwards, at the start of each new stage in the design process, research has a central role. Research provides plenty of insights; how people act/think/feel and who the intended users are, within the context of the challenge.
These insights are the key to a solution, but they have to be translated into actual design requirements: which are key for the optimal solution. This is something that can be decided on the basis of research, and implemented and tested by creating a prototype. A next step might be to research again into what you created by setting up a test with users. During the project there is a constant two-way flow: from research through translation to creation, and from creation through translation to research.###<span id="scrum">SCRUM</span>Scrum is an iterative and incremental process for the design and development of products and services, and it has a very specific way of organizing a team. Tasks are achieved faster and with higher quality when using the Scrum Framework.This is possible because of the high self-motivation of the team, which chooses its own tasks and how to execute them. The project partner’s demands are iteratively prioritized and quickly actualized. The flow of the design process is embedded in a sprint-based schedule, ideally supported by Scrum roles, rituals, sessions and artifacts that support the process.###<span id="sprints">SPRINTS</span>A ‘sprint’ (or iteration) is the basic unit of development. The sprint is a ‘timeboxed’ effort; that is, it is restricted to a specific duration. The sprints in the PublishingLab have an average duration of three weeks. However, teams are free to perform more sprints within those scheduled three weeks.###<span id="rituals">RITUALS</span>Specific ‘rituals’ guide the development of a sprint. Each sprint starts with an ideation and planning session, has a mid-sprint translation / transfer session, and ends with a sprint review meeting and retrospective. During a sprint, the team has daily stand-up meetings.

![](imgs/figure2.png)
<!--image of bad quality, but gives an idea of what is desired. symbol can be changed.-->

Figure 2. MediaLAB Amsterdam Design Process (source Manual MediaLAB Design Process 2014).1. DAILY STAND-UP MEETINGS
The daily stand-up meeting takes place at the same time and place of every working day. The daily scrum meeting is held in the morning, as it helps set the context for the coming day’s work. These scrum meetings are strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes. This keeps the discussion brisk but relevant.
The daily stand-up meeting is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues raised are usually dealt with immediately after the meeting. During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:
	1. What did you do yesterday?	2. What will you do today?	3. Are there any barriers in your way?2. IDEATION AND PLANNINGEvery sprint has a ‘ideation and planning’ session. In this session the creative process is triggered by the facilitation of a brainstorm and ideation session in which ideas are identi ed and quickly sketched. The most promising ideas are placed in a hierarchy and it is decided which have potential to be taken along in the sprint. After this, tasks are identi ed, but more importantly the exact sprint goal (and duration) is defined. It is important to have a very clear goal, so that the team can break the e ort down into smaller-sized pieces that contribute to achieving that goal more smoothly,
3. TRANSLATE AND TRANSFERIn the middle of the 3-week sprint there is a scheduled ‘translate and transfer’ session in which your team and the project-related researchers come together to translate research insights and decide which things to act on in this sprint or the next (transfer).4. SPRINT REVIEWAfter the team has completed the planned deliverables for this sprint it is time for the ‘sprint review’. In this meeting, which is organized with all stakeholders present, decisions on progress and how to proceed are made, including next steps and possible needs and wishes. Specifically, the team will present the work they did during the sprint and will run through the sprint backlog together with stakeholders.5. SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE
A ‘sprint retrospective’ or ‘peer pitch’ is held at the very end of each sprint. This is a meeting to re ect on both the results and the processes with the team. It is meant to change, improve, or stick to the way they work and function as a team.

##<span id="workshops">WORKSHOPS</span>

###<span id="scrum">SCRUM</span>
To structure the collaborative process of your project, we use the Scrum method. By setting clearly defined goals and dividing roles and tasks between team members, the method allows for an iterative approach to challenges and breaks larger goals up into achievable parts. During this workshop you will familiarize yourself with this way of working.

###<span id="presentation">PRESENTATION SKILLS</span>
Working on a project for a client means that you have to present your research, findings, plans and advice to them in a professional manner. This workshop is designed to help you make well structured and convincing presentations.

###<span id="publishing">DIY PUBLISHING</span>
<!-- @Silvio: this is your workshop, could you add a description? -->

###<span id="ideation">IDEATION</span>
<!-- @Margreet: I don't know what to write for this one-->

###<span id="ux">UX DESIGN</span>
<!-- @Margreet: I don't know what to write for this one-->

###<span id="prototyping">PROTOTYPING</span>
How do you test your concepts without spending a lot of time programming only to discover something doesn't work the way you expected it to? From quick paper prototyping to increasingly high fidelity techniques, this workshop will teach you more about different methods of prototyping and when and why they are useful.

###<span id="git">GIT</span>
Git is a source code management system that allows collaborative work and version control. It is an important component of the Hybrid Publishing Toolkit and widely used for developers in a multitude of projects. In this workshop we'll go through the basics of using Git by starting a collaborative project on GitHub. We'll use the command line and a graphical interface, so that you can experiment both and choose your favorite.

<!-- ###<span id="CSS"></span> -->
###<span id="HTML">HTML & CSS</span>
HTML and CSS are the foundation of design for the web. They are also core languages in EPUB development. In this workshop we'll review the basics of HTML5 and CSS3:

*   anatomy of a HTML file
*   HTML tags (headings, paragraphs, links, navigation, multimedia, divs and spans)
*   classes and ids
*   CSS selectors
*   the Box Model
*   the Flexible Box
*   typography
*   animations and transitions
*   media queries

###<span id="javascript">JAVASCRIPT</span>
Javascript, or simply JS, is responsible for the interaction in web pages. In the JS workshop we'll cover:

*   the DOM
*   DOM events
*   variables and functions
*   how to use JS to add interaction to your pages

###<span id="inspector">INSPECTOR</span>
The page inspector is a handy tool available in modern browsers. It helps us examine HTML, CSS and JS and allows us to edit and debug.

*   the page source x the page inspector
*   examine and edit HTML
*   examine and edit CSS
*   the console

##<span id="masterclass">MASTERCLASS<span>
During the semester Geert Lovink, founder of the [Institute of Network Cultures] (http://networkcultures.org) will give a two-day masterclass. Geert will cover three topics. The morning session is dedicated to internet criticism after 2008. In the afternoon we will discuss two INC networks: [Unlike Us] (http://networkcultures.org/unlikeus), alternatives in social media, and [Society of the Query] (http://networkcultures.org/query), on the politics and aesthetics of search.

Navigating Theory on Demand (2015)

<!--challenge / research question:-->
How do we maximize efficiency and co-existence of the various formats (epub, print, HTML) for the INC 'Theory on Demand' series?

<!--short alinea what the project is about-->
The 'Theory on Demand' series is currently hosted on the INC website, which, unfortunately, is lacking a comprehensive searching tool or a filter to access the content of the publication. Although the current website has favourable aesthetics, it functions as a static and non-navigable platform. What can an ideal (and effective) academic publication look like in the digital realm?

<!--connect research paper-->
The project task involved adapting the already existing print and static content of the INC’s ‘Theory on Demand’ series onto the digital screens, more precisely, creating a fully digital version of the book, making use of the advantages and the possibilities of the web-page format. It can be seen as existing in the context of other innovative online publications such as [Open!](http://www.onlineopen.org/index.php) and [Fold](http://www.onlineopen.org/index.php).

###<span id="unstudio">UNSTUDIO</span>
<!-- title (year) -->
Knowledge Matters - Interactive Book App (2015)

<!-- challenge / research question: -->
How can an interactive experience help a reader understand the architectural principles underpinning 25+ years of work and research in a way that print can’t?

<!-- editor , here's an alternative version -->

<!--How can we start a dialogue between print and digital media? And how can the values, methods and language of UNStudio be enhanced with an immersive digital experience?-->

<!-- short alinea what the project is about -->
Knowledge Matters app is a digital extension of a printed book by UNStudio, that represents the Arnhem Station project as an interactive experience. It is divided in two ways of navigating through the content, based on time.

The “fast” mode is a selection of material thought to be presented as highlights of the project. It is a linear narrative, presented within a chronological order, as a timeline. The “slow mode” offers more detailed information on the project which fits the “academic” type of user, who is searching for in-depth knowledge. A non-linear menu allows the user to make intuitive choices and construct his own story.

<!-- connect research paper -->
The interactive book ‘Knowledge Matters’ started with the premise to design an extension of a printed book: maybe a digital book? While analyzing and selecting material from the digital archive of The UNStudio, and feeling its potential, we immediately understood that a new approach had to be considered. Maybe not a mere translation between a printed matter and a digital one, instead an exploration of the digital format in such a way that in the printed matter would not be possible.

By enhancing the non-linear quality of the navigation, distintictive from the digital media, and by giving priority to material in motion and interacte features, we decided to create an app. A combination of programming languages (html5, css and javascript) together with graphic studies, shared motivation and enthusiasm made the ‘Knowledge Matters’ a very unconventional book.
