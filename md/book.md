##<span id="about">ABOUT</span>
Welcome to [PublishingLab] (http://publishinglab.org), this section tells you a bit about who we are, who our interns are and who our partners are. You will also find an overview of what we do.

###<span id="whoarewe">WHO ARE WE</span>
The PublishingLab is an applied research lab in the field of hybrid publishing working at the intersection of publishing and digital technology, both in print and digitally. We are part of the Amsterdam Creative Industries Network (ACIN), Create-IT research center and the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. The world of digital publishing has been growing steadily for several years. The arrival of tablets and smartphones has accelerated these developments, and today it is impossible to imagine a media landscape without e-books, newspaper apps, and digital magazines. Digitalization is turning the field upside down! This is where the PublishingLab comes in.

The PublishingLab is part of [ACIN](http://www.amsterdamcreativeindustries.com), the national talent, knowledge and business network for creative industry and digital technology. ACIN was founded by the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, the Amsterdam School of the Arts and Inholland University of Applied Sciences. ACIN currently hosts 11 other labs such as Art&Technology lab, Fashion&Technology lab, Gamelab, etc. PublishingLab is based in Benno Premselahuis, at the School of Design & Communication from the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. Students, teachers and researchers work together on applied research with the creative industries and the ICT sector. The results will be used in curriculum development and for consulting the industry. Together with the [Institute of Network Cultures] (http://networkcultures.org) (INC), PublishingLab is located on the Amstel Campus Amsterdam.

###<span id="whoourinternsare">WHO OUR INTERNS ARE</span>
PublishingLab works with students from different backgrounds, offering a wide range of opportunities to its students – from experimenting with digital publishing work flows to testing user interface design. We like to work with students who don’t give up easily; who like experimenting with text, typography, code, (moving) images and the opportunities that digital media provide. We work with students with design, hacking, writing and many other skills; the teams are multidisciplinary and selected to fit the needs of the project. We’re looking for motivated people who respond to opportunities and challenges intelligently, creatively and want to push the boundaries of hybrid publishing.

###<span id="whoourpartnersare">WHO OUR PARTNERS ARE</span>
PublishingLab works with various partners, ranging from government institutions, Dutch SMEs, and large international corporations in the field of digital media and publishing. Our projects are always shaped in co-creation with our partners. Working with partners means the PublishingLab has a good network in Amsterdams creative industries. Recent partners include Persgroep Nederland, Persgroep Digitaal, WeekbladpersGroep, UNStudio, Canon, Cinekid, Hogeschool Bibliotheek Amsterdam, Het Vlaams-Nederlands platform Laboratorium Actuele Kunstkritiek, Domein voor Kunstkritiek, rekto:verso, Archined, Piet Zwart Institute and many others.

<!--maybe add some queotes from partners-->

###<span id="whatwedo">WHAT WE DO</span>
<!--underneath section needs to be rephrased -->
At the PublishingLab, our research is directed towards the following three groups:

1. makers (authors, designers);
2. intermediaries (publishers);
3. end users (readers / students).
The PublishingLab conducts applied research by doing innovative experiments in the field of (digital) publishing. This includes research on the impact of developments on the branch as a whole, conducting small experiments in the field of EPUB3 (such as research/work on user interface design for collaborative online editing environments), research/work on conveying hybrid publishing concepts and work flows to a non-expert audience or experiments with the aim of solving interesting design problems.

##<span id="lab">LAB: HOW TO</span>
This section is about how to conduct yourself in the lab, how to work in a team, and how to best present your work.

###<span id="teamwork">MULTIDISCIPLINARY AND MULTICULTURAL TEAM WORK</span>
At the PublishingLab you will work in a team of people with different skill sets and from different educational and cultural backgrounds. These differences can have an impact on how a team works together. Working in a team with a varied composition therefore requires a special attitude, both professionally and socially. Here are some things you should take into account.

###<span id="language">LANGUAGE</span>
Multidisciplinary and multicultural teams are great for creative processes. However, when people who work together have different languages, this can be an obstacle to success. Speaking in your mother tongue is very different from speaking in a second or third language. So please consider your words carefully; issues of differing interpretations may arrise, as well as cultural differences, especially when the English is not the first language of either of you. Be proactive to overcome these differences: use visuals, write down your ideas, sketch. Make sure you understand each other.
###<span id="communication">STYLES OF COMMUNICATION</span>
Methods of communication that are normal for one group of people may appear ineffective or inappropriate to another group. A person from a culture in which loud voices and interruptions are not seen as aggressive may intimidate someone from a culture that teaches more reserved modes of expression. Learning about the cultures of your team members before you start working with them can help you understand their methods of communication.

###<span id="hierarchy">HIERARCHY</span>
The importance placed in figures of authority varies greatly between cultures. Some groups give great respect to people in positions of authority, while people from other cultures are perfectly willing to question an authority figure if they see them doing something wrong. Additionally, authority is based on different criteria in different cultures.

###<span id="conflict">IN CASE OF CONFLICT</span>
When conflict does occur within a team, members from different backgrounds may react to the situation in dramatically different ways. Some people will repress their reactions to an insult, while others will fight back. These reactions are based on individual personality to some extent but are also conditioned by a person’s background. Resolving conflict requires:
* listening to the other person/people calmly
* an understanding of everyone’s view of what caused the conflict
* being open and respectful to each other’s background

You can ask your coach to mediate if you feel your attempts at solving the conflict are not working.
###<span id="presenting">PRESENTING YOUR WORK</span>
At the end of the design process you will have the opportunity to share what you created with the world. We use our website as a communication portal for all our projects, but you will also present your results to the creative industries during a final event.

###<span id="blog">BLOG</span>
One of the PublishingLab’s most important communication channels is its blog. Here, project teams keep followers and friends updated on the latest developments and insights in their projects or in related fields. As a team we trust you are just as proud of your work as we are, and just as keen to share its news on a regular basis. In the first week you will learn how our blog works and how you can best communicate and promote your team’s work there. You will be expected to write a blog post at least twice a month during your internship.

###<span id="documentation">SHARING, WORKING AND DOCUMENTATION</span>
To work together efficiently you’ll need tools to collaborate on projects, share documents and calendars, and communicate. There are huge numbers of digital tools available to help you with this: use them! The right tools will put the most relevant information within easy reach. See the tools section on our website for inspiration.


##<span id="process">PROCESS</span>
This section explains how we work: the process and design methods for completing your project.

One of the methods we use, is the MediaLAB Amsterdam design process <!--insert link to design process-->, which is a problem-solving method that helps create and evaluate solutions in response to challenges. In this process one tries to evoke real curiosity in order to make teams feel highly motivated to  nd answers and solutions. This involves lots of iterations, making, prototyping, going out on field studies and testing each idea, concept or prototype with actual users.

Figure 1. MediaLAB Amsterdam Design Process, Research, Translate and Create phase (source: Manual MediaLAB Design Process 2014).###<span id="researchtranslatecreate">RESEARCH, TRANSLATE AND CREATE</span>At the start of each new stage in the design process, research has a central role. Research provides plenty of insights, for example about how people act/think/feel and who the intended users are. These insights are the key to finding a solution, but first they have to be translated into actual design decisions. Making a prototype based on these decisions will help you test their effectiveness. A next step might be to go back to the research to find other solutions, or to set up a test with users. During the project there is a constant two-way flow: from research through translation to creation, and from creation through translation to research.###<span id="scrum">SCRUM</span>Scrum is an iterative and incremental process for the design and development of products and services, and it has a very specific way of organizing a team. Tasks are achieved faster and with higher quality when using the Scrum Framework. This is possible because of the high self-motivation of the team, which chooses its own tasks and how to execute them. The project partner’s demands are iteratively prioritized and quickly actualized. The flow of the design process is embedded in a sprint-based schedule, ideally supported by Scrum roles, rituals, sessions and artifacts that support the process.###<span id="sprints">SPRINTS</span>A ‘sprint’ (or iteration) is the basic unit of development. The sprint is a ‘timeboxed’ effort: it is restricted to a specific duration. The sprints in the PublishingLab have an average duration of three weeks. However, teams are free to perform more sprints within those scheduled three weeks.###<span id="rituals">RITUALS</span>Specific ‘rituals’ guide the development of a sprint. Each sprint starts with an ideation and planning session, has a mid-sprint translation / transfer session, and ends with a sprint review meeting and retrospective. During a sprint, the team has daily stand-up meetings.

###<span id="researchtranslatecreate">RESEARCH, TRANSLATE AND CREATE</span>
At the start of every design challenge, and afterwards, at the start of each new stage in the design process, research has a central role. Research provides plenty of insights; how people act/think/feel and who the intended users are, within the context of the challenge.
These insights are the key to a solution, but they have to be translated into actual design requirements: which are key for the optimal solution. This is something that can be decided on the basis of research, and implemented and tested by creating a prototype. A next step might be to research again into what you created by setting up a test with users. During the project there is a constant two-way flow: from research through translation to creation, and from creation through translation to research.

###<span id="scrum">SCRUM</span>
Scrum is an iterative and incremental process for the design and development of products and services, and it has a very specific way of organizing a team. Tasks are achieved faster and with higher quality when using the Scrum Framework.
This is possible because of the high self-motivation of the team, which chooses its own tasks and how to execute them. The project partner’s demands are iteratively prioritized and quickly actualized. The flow of the design process is embedded in a sprint-based schedule, ideally supported by Scrum roles, rituals, sessions and artifacts that support the process.

###<span id="sprints">SPRINTS</span>
A ‘sprint’ (or iteration) is the basic unit of development. The sprint is a ‘timeboxed’ effort; that is, it is restricted to a specific duration. The sprints in the PublishingLab have an average duration of three weeks. However, teams are free to perform more sprints within those scheduled three weeks.

###<span id="rituals">RITUALS</span>
Specific ‘rituals’ guide the development of a sprint. Each sprint starts with an ideation and planning session, has a mid-sprint translation / transfer session, and ends with a sprint review meeting and retrospective. During a sprint, the team has daily stand-up meetings.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Figure 2. MediaLAB Amsterdam Design Process (source: Manual MediaLAB Design Process 2014).1. DAILY STAND-UP MEETINGS
The daily stand-up meeting takes place at the same time and place of every working day. The daily scrum meeting is held in the morning, as it helps set the goal for the coming day’s work. These scrum meetings are strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes. This keeps the discussion brisk and relevant.
The daily stand-up meeting is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues raised are usually dealt with immediately after the meeting. During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:
	1. What did you do yesterday?	2. What will you do today?	3. Are there any barriers in your way?2. IDEATION AND PLANNINGEvery sprint has a ‘ideation and planning’ session. In this session the creative process is triggered by the facilitation of a brainstorm and ideation session in which ideas are identified and quickly sketched. The most promising ideas are placed in a hierarchy and a decision is made which of these will be taken along in the sprint. After this, tasks are identified, but more importantly the exact sprint goal (and duration) is defined. It is important to have a very clear goal, so that the team can break the effort down into smaller pieces that contribute to achieving that goal more smoothly.
3. TRANSLATE AND TRANSFERIn the middle of the 3-week sprint there is a scheduled ‘translate and transfer’ session in which your team and the project-related researchers come together to translate research insights and decide which things to act on in this sprint or the next (transfer).4. SPRINT REVIEWAfter the team has completed the planned deliverables for this sprint it is time for the ‘sprint review’. In this meeting, which is organized with all stakeholders present, decisions on progress and how to proceed are made, including next steps and possible needs and wishes. Specifically, the team will present the work they did during the sprint and will run through the sprint backlog together with stakeholders.5. SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE
A ‘sprint retrospective’ is held at the very end of each sprint. This is a meeting to reflect on both the results and the processes with the team. It is meant to change, improve, or stick to the way you work and function as a team.

2. IDEATION AND PLANNING

Every sprint has a ‘ideation and planning’ session. In this session the creative process is triggered by the facilitation of a brainstorm and ideation session in which ideas are identi ed and quickly sketched. The most promising ideas are placed in a hierarchy and it is decided which have potential to be taken along in the sprint. After this, tasks are identi ed, but more importantly the exact sprint goal (and duration) is defined. It is important to have a very clear goal, so that the team can break the e ort down into smaller-sized pieces that contribute to achieving that goal more smoothly,

##<span id="workshops">WORKSHOPS</span>

###<span id="scrum">SCRUM</span>
To structure the collaborative process of your project, we use the Scrum method. By setting clearly defined goals and dividing roles and tasks between team members, the method allows for an iterative approach to challenges and breaks larger goals up into achievable parts. During this workshop you will familiarize yourself with this way of working.

###<span id="presentation">PRESENTATION SKILLS</span>
Working on a project for a client means that you have to present your research, findings, plans and advice to them in a professional manner. This workshop is designed to help you make well structured and convincing presentations.

###<span id="publishing">DIY PUBLISHING</span>
<!-- @Silvio: this is your workshop, could you add a description? -->

###<span id="ideation">IDEATION</span>
<!-- @Margreet: I don't know what to write for this one-->

###<span id="ux">UX DESIGN</span>
<!-- @Margreet: I don't know what to write for this one-->

###<span id="prototyping">PROTOTYPING</span>
How do you test your concepts without spending a lot of time programming only to discover something doesn't work the way you expected it to? From quick paper prototyping to increasingly high fidelity techniques, this workshop will teach you more about different methods of prototyping and when and why they are useful.

###<span id="git">GIT</span>
Git is a source code management system that allows collaborative work and version control. It is an important component of the Hybrid Publishing Toolkit and widely used for developers in a multitude of projects. In this workshop we'll go through the basics of using Git by starting a collaborative project on GitHub. We'll use the command line and a graphical interface, so that you can experiment with both and choose your favorite.

###<span id="HTML">HTML & CSS</span>
HTML and CSS are the foundation of design for the web. They are also core languages in epub development. While HTML is responsible for the structure of the document, CSS is in charge of how it looks. This workshop will review the basics of HTML5 and CSS3: from the anatomy of a HTML file and CSS selectors to CSS animations and transitions.

###<span id="javascript">JAVASCRIPT</span>
Javascript, or simply JS, is responsible for the interaction in web pages. Understanding the DOM (Document Object Model), DOM events, variables, functions and how to use JS to add interaction to your pages is what this workshop is all about.

###<span id="inspector">INSPECTOR</span>
The page inspector is a handy tool available in modern web browsers. It helps us examine HTML, CSS and JS and allows us to edit and debug our code - all in the browser and with instantly viewable results!

###<span id="design">DESIGN</span>




##<span id="masterclass">MASTERCLASS<span>
During the semester Geert Lovink, founder of the [Institute of Network Cultures] (http://networkcultures.org) will give a two-day masterclass. Geert will cover three topics: the first session is dedicated to internet criticism after 2008, the second to discussing two INC networks: [Unlike Us] (http://networkcultures.org/unlikeus) about alternatives in social media, and [Society of the Query] (http://networkcultures.org/query), on the politics and aesthetics of search.

<!--challenge / research question:-->
How can De Persgroep build sustainable relationships with millennial readers that arrive to their articles through social media links?

<!--short alinea what the project is about-->
De Persgroep notices that many visits to their sites can be characterized as 'hit 'n' run'; the reader clicks on a link in their Facebook timeline or Twitter feed, reads 1 article while hardly being aware of the site it is part of, and leaves without any promise of returning. They want to find innovative ways of taking this first moment of interaction between a new reader and their brand further and build a sustainable relationship.

<!--connect research paper-->
Millennials grew up in a world of free online news; news sites sold ads to companies and readers payed with their attention and clicks instead of their money. With the advent of adblockers and overall disappointing ad effectiveness, this exchange isn't as profitable as it once was imagined to be. News sites the world over are struggling to keep afloat and engaging a new generation of readers seems essential in acchieving this. If millennials won't commit to 1 medium and pay a substantive subscription fee, what are innovative ways for news sites to make their product profitable and sustainable?

<!--challenge / research question:-->
How do we maximize efficiency and co-existence of the various formats (epub, print, HTML) for the INC 'Theory on Demand' series?

<!--short alinea what the project is about-->
The 'Theory on Demand' series is currently hosted on the INC website, which, unfortunately, is lacking a comprehensive searching tool or a filter to access the content of the publication. Although the current website has favourable aesthetics, it functions as a static and non-navigable platform. What can an ideal (and effective) academic publication look like in the digital realm?

<!--How can we start a dialogue between print and digital media? And how can the values, methods and language of UNStudio be enhanced with an immersive digital experience?-->

<!-- short alinea what the project is about -->
The Knowledge Matters app is a digital extension of a printed book by UNStudio, presenting the Arnhem train station project as an interactive experience. It is divided in two ways of navigating through the content, based on time. The 'fast' mode is a selection of material presented as highlights of the project in linear narrative on a timeline. The 'slow mode' offers more detailed information on the project fitting the academic type of user who is searching for in-depth knowledge. Here, the non-linear menu allows the user to make intuitive choices and construct his or her own story.

<!-- short alinea what the project is about -->
Knowledge Matters app is a digital extension of a printed book by UNStudio, that represents the Arnhem Station project as an interactive experience. It is divided in two ways of navigating through the content, based on time.

The “fast” mode is a selection of material thought to be presented as highlights of the project. It is a linear narrative, presented within a chronological order, as a timeline. The “slow mode” offers more detailed information on the project which fits the “academic” type of user, who is searching for in-depth knowledge. A non-linear menu allows the user to make intuitive choices and construct his own story.

<!-- connect research paper -->
The goal of the interactive book ‘Knowledge Matters’ was to design an extension of a printed book: maybe a digital book? While analyzing and selecting material from the digital archive of The UNStudio and becoming aware of its potential, we understood that a new approach had to be considered. Maybe not a mere translation between a printed matter and a digital one, but instead an exploration of the digital format in a way that would not be possible in the printed form.

We decided to create an app that would enhance the non-linear quality of the navigation and give priority to material in motion and interacte features. A combination of programming languages (HTML5, CSS and Javascript), together with graphic studies, shared motivation and enthusiasm made ‘Knowledge Matters’ a very unconventional book.

# Test title and the Autonomy of Art: The Culture of Power, the Power of Culture[^Test-chapter_1]

<span class="author">James R. Spanner</span>

Lorem Ipsum, advanced neoliberal reforms are taking place at a much
faster pace than in other parts of the world. These reforms have
delivered not only new forms of life and making a living but also new
sensibilities. 

<blockquote>
New blockquote Lorem ipsum.
</blockquote>

The erosion of the social contract brought by these
reforms, has had tangible (all negative) effects on the social tissue.
This has materialized, for example, in what is known as the most violent
and dangerous city in the world, Ciudad Juárez, where in 2010 alone,
3000 people were killed. Bearing this in mind, I am defining
neoliberalism as a *sensibility* that shapes subjectivities, permeates
art and culture, differentiates and homogenizes people, molds lives and
desires, mistakes information for knowledge, gives shape to space and
thus to social relations, normalizes violence, creates ways of seeing
the world giving shape to common sense that justifies destruction and
dispossession with notions progress and development, or that tries to
solve economic precarity with self-help and permanent education. I argue
that neoliberalism is more than a system that is ruled by a free market
economy, which implies the privatization of the welfare state and an
array of government services (for example: education, health, energy),
subcontracting to the private sector and changes in labor laws and
worker’s rights as well as a transnational division of labor. The system
of control under neoliberalism combines a militarized police regime with
repressive tolerance, the logic of securitization with granting freedom
of expression and ‘quality of life.’ The political figures, molded and
governed by the neoliberal regime itself are: *homo oeconomicus* (or
entrepreneur, responsible for his own well-being and manager of his own
human capital) and the subject of rights (the State is in charge of
guaranteeing that his human rights are respected). Aside from an
economic-political system, I see neoliberalism as a way of relating to
the world, to nature, to things and beings, which presupposes unlimited
growth and development. It is also a way of living and working: human
beings are being put to work beyond their capacities, erasing the
distinction between the leisure and work time. Neoliberalism is also a
sensibility that establishes the terms of empathy and sympathy and has
outlined a new notion of alterity. Configured as ‘social responsibility’
or social work, to ‘help’ the Other means to focus on the (so-called)
‘secondary malfunctions’ of the current capitalist system by
disseminating personal and managerial practices such as tolerance,
showing respect, nurturing dialogue, transparency and social
collaboration. In this sense, the “Other” is a ‘community to come,’ the
‘subject of rights’ (and to ethical restitution: refugees, displaced,
immigrants, those who live under a ‘state of exception’), the
*underclass*, that is, he or she who will be permanently outside
globalizing process, including access to education, jobs and
consumption. The category of the “Other” encompasses as well, political
and religious fundamentalists, fanatics who are outside globalizing and
modernizing processes by choice. These *Others* are sometimes given
faces in the media or in art by spectacularizing their subjectivity but
obviating the processes that placed them in those very situations that
render their lives precarious and endangered in the first place.

## Section

### This is a subsection

What has this got to do with the autonomy of art? As we will see, with
postmodernism, art and culture came to be at the center of social,
political and economic processes and are now inextricable from work,
production, consumption and subjectivity: in the neoliberal regime, art
in particular and culture in general are being used actively as
compensation and improvement of tools, normalizing and spreading the
antithesis of autonomous art, that is, ‘useful art.’ Subsumed to
political action, much of contemporary art has taken up a political role
as either ‘sensible politics’ or ‘socially engaged artwork.’ This is
tied to the fact that in our current world order, as Vishmidt and
Stakemeier point out, “Art no longer designates a reproductive and
representational realm, but one of productivity and social power” and
thus the autonomy of art itself has become a problem – in so far as it
has become a realm for the production of added value.[^Test-chapter_2]

In the September 2013 editorial of *e-flux journal*, the editors stated
that art is produced at a double bind: while art can be complicit or
instrumentalized by power, its autonomy is located in an imaginary
space. What do they mean by this? First, that art, in order to be
*seen*, depends on a platform – an institution – and thus needs to be
part of some art world. Second, that the autonomy of art – as a separate
regime or an isolated sphere – is a fantasy. In order to consider the
autonomy of art outside of this double bind, Clement Greenberg tied the
autonomy of art – as art’s for art’s sake – to the avant-garde situating
criticality within the discipline or medium of art itself. Clearly
taking a position against socialist realist painting and those debates
of the 1930s relying on the relationship between art and politics
(embodied for example, by socialist realism or Mexican muralist
painting, which was very popular in New York in the 1930s) in
Greenberg’s definition, avant-garde (Modernist) painting was
characterized by self-critique in the sense that its formal expression
is a meditation on the qualities of the medium of painting. This meant
extricating figuration from the arts, and an essentialist understanding
of the mediums of art: for Greenberg, ‘purity’ was political –
especially if it was seen as an embodiment of a free nation versus the
authoritarian Soviet Union.

Postmodernism could be understood as an effort to break with Greenberg’s
disciplinary totalitarianism. Taking up the Dadaist and surrealist
avant-garde’s goals of unifying art and life, postmodernism thrived with
the advent of interdisciplinary strategies and in the symbiosis of art
with everything else. Post-war art continued the vanguardist critique of
the bourgeois notions of autonomous art and expressive artists,
embracing everyday objects, transforming the artist’s function,
questioning the institution of art or attacking it in the anarchist
manner.[^Test-chapter_3] Following Hal Foster, art from the 1950s and 1960s
represents the failure to destroy the institution of art and the
institutionalization of the avant-garde.[^Test-chapter_4] If Greenberg advocated
aesthetic autonomy with the purpose of resisting illustrational meanings
prone to kitsch and commercial forces, post-modernist’s inter
disciplinary strategies led art, in Foster’s words, “to become embedded
into life under the terms of mass capitalism, while it became
appropriated by the culture industry.”[^Test-chapter_5] Due to its ‘post-medium’
condition, as Rosalind Krauss termed ‘postmodern interdisciplinarity,’
art is enmeshed with reality, and its materials can range from social
interaction, scientific research, montage, etc. With postmodernism, the
politics of the autonomy of art meant breaking away from in Greenberg’s
sense of purity and thus art’s autonomy came to be conceived as
“provisional, always defined diacritically (as something supplemental to
art) and situated politically, always *semi*.”[^Test-chapter_6]

Beyond postmodernism, parallel to the increase of corporate subsidy to
the arts, there has been a recent boom in private collecting and thus a
market boom; the value of art is speculative and reflects the logic of
finance-based economy (and risk), and the economy and critical art share
the core value of ‘innovation.’ In this regard, neoliberalism has meant
for the arts privatization or the collusion between the private and the
public sector in order to subsidize them. In the past decade or so (and
in the US long before that), corporations have played an important role
in investing in culture, as institutions and corporations seek to play
an important role in communicating the private sector point of view on
an array of critical public topics.[^Test-chapter_7] If art was previously supported
by the state, because culture was considered to be an asset to the
nation, today, corporations have appropriated this function, as they
sponsor and jury art shows, grant awards and funds and collect artworks.
Meanwhile, they promote their perspective on critical public topics.[^Test-chapter_8]
In a 1998 article, art historian Chin-tao Wu highlighted how
corporations appropriated the concept of innovation – also known as
innovative disruption or creative destruction – in order to redefine its
meaning in corporate terms. She quotes Philip Morris Inc.’s – the U.S.
cigarette company – executive vice-president, John Murphy, on their
sponsorship of the 1969 exhibition, *When Attitudes Become Form*:

> …We feel it is appropriate that we participate in bringing these works
> to the attention of the public, for there is a key element in this
> ‘new art’ which has its counterpart in the business world. That
> element is *innovation* – without which it would be impossible for
> progress to be made in any segment in society.[^Test-chapter_9]

Furthermore, in the context of neoliberal reforms and sensibility, there
is a global tendency to subdue contemporary art to the politics of
culture administration, which implies “democratizing culture” making it
accessible to the masses, using it as a tool for the well-being of
society, for the reconstruction or healing of a community or society
that has experienced violence. Cultural institutions subsidized by
corporations and individual patrons apparently follow progressive
agendas promoting political – or socially minded art. For instance,
*Creative Time* in New York (funded by a mix of state and corporate
support) supports public and community art, with the goal of enabling
the politicization of social space with cultural intervention. This
organization sponsored Tania Bruguera’s “Immigrant Movement
International,” a project developed in Queens (2011), New York, which
the artist describes as: a flexible community space and long-term
socio-political movement, public workshops, events, actions and
partnerships with immigrant and service organizations; the artist
further qualified her project as “useful art.”[^Test-chapter_10] The problem is that
initiatives such as this one, render opaque the real economic conditions
that led to situations of immigrant precarity to begin with: immigrants
are local signs of complex global forces operating on their conditions
of life and work at home and abroad. Many would argue that subsidy to
projects like Bruguera’s signals the transfer of social work to artistic
work funded by the private sector. In regards to this, politics comes
into the scene through art as social work in the name of ‘public
interest,’ only to become subject to administration, engineering and a
technocratic way of administering social problems, configuring the
private version of the welfare state.[^Test-chapter_11] Furthermore, as the corporate
support to the establishment of antagonistic spaces becomes gradually
institutionalized within society, the question rises, after Gregory
Sholette , “Who owns cultural capital and who has the right to use it?”
.

As for him, corporate involvement in the arts is akin – or perhaps
integral to – to the current erosion of public space.[^Test-chapter_12] Moreover, as
cultural spaces become institutional bastions of democratic
self-expression and sites for social reconciliation and self-help,
dissent is criminalized and forcefully punished worldwide.

It becomes evident that in the neoliberal globalized world, art and
culture are central to neoliberal processes as agents of globalization,
as tools for improvement and development, counterinsurgency and
pacification. An extreme example could be the ‘culturally sensible’
occupation of Iraq as described by Nato Thompson (director of *Creative
Time*). In uncritical terms, Thompson recounts how General David
Petraeus wrote a field manual geared at changing people’s attitudes
towards American occupation in Mosul; as exemplified in:

> A story about counterinsurgency and community organizing, about
> getting to know people as an occupying force, and getting to know
> people as neighbors. It is a story about the military entering the
> terrain of that thing called culture.[^Test-chapter_13]

In this regard, a ‘cultural approach’ to military occupation is akin to
artistic social and community practices, as both involve “getting to
know people to be able to change the landscapes of life and of
power.”[^Test-chapter_14] In the case of civilians in Mosul, this is done obviating
their experiences under attack. This cultural turn in the U.S. military
machinery took place a few years after theorist Frederic Jameson
diagnosed a “cultural turn” in capitalism, arguing that social space had
been completely saturated with the image of culture. This is because in
professional and daily activities, as well as in the various forms of
entertainment we enjoy, society consumes cultural products all the time.
The postmodern “cultural turn” diagnosed by Jameson, was further
elaborated by George Yúdice upon observing (in 2003) that the uses of
culture had undergone an unprecedented expansion not just in the
marketplace but also along social, political, and economic lines.
According to Yúdice, since the state and corporations already utilize
culture as a tool as they search for economic and sociopolitical
betterment, culture has become a resource and a compensatory device to
the ravages neoliberal policies have caused on the social tissue: both
give meaning and symbolic representations, provide mechanisms of solace,
as well as tools for re-invention and amelioration.[^Test-chapter_15] In this
context, the line between public programs and relational aesthetics or
participative art appears to be increasingly blurred. Former Mexican
president Felipe Calderón made a public appearance in February 2012 in
Ciudad Juárez before a sign that stated: “No More Weapons.” The
billboard measured 8 x 21 m, and was built by soldiers of the National
Defense Department with 3 tons of assault weapons confiscated at the
border and molten into bricks. During the ceremony in which the
billboard was unveiled, Calderón turned toward the Mexican-American
border and begged the U.S. (in bad English): “No more weapons! Dear
friends of the United States, Mexico needs your help to stop this
terrible violence we are suffering.” During this trip, Calderón also
participated in the destruction of 6 thousand confiscated weapons, and
planted a tree at a Community Center. Calderon’s propagandistic gestures
immediately recall the language of socially engaged contemporary art,
particularly, Pedro Reyes’ intervention, *Palas por pistolas* in
Culiacán in 2008 (also executed in Juárez in the same week of Calderon’s
visit). Reyes’ project of exchanging shovels for weapons was subsidized
by two predominant Mexican corporations: Trupper (which producers
hardware) and Coppel (which sells appliances and other goods). For this
project, Reyes devised a Television campaign inviting citizens to give
up their weapons in exchange for a coupon exchangeable for appliances.
The artist collected 1527 weapons, which were destroyed at a military
zone in a public act. Giving his action a further twist, Reyes sought to
have the rests of the weapons welded together to produce 1527 shovels
carrying an inscription telling the story of the weapon they represented
(this was not possible due to technical reasons, so Trupper ended up
donating them). The engraved shovels were distributed in art
institutions and public schools and adults and children planted 1527
trees. To Reyes, this ritual had a pedagogical purpose: “to show the
people how an agent of death can become an agent of life.”[^Test-chapter_16] A
similar public purge of weapons in exchange for appliances (and
tablets), is currently happening in Mexico City led by a “Pink Ladies
Brigade.” These relational actions – both by General Petraeus’ and by
the Mexican government, show how the language of contemporary art has
been appropriated by propaganda for its purposes, making politics and
aesthetics indistinguishable, as both operate in the realm of symbolic
and perceptive work. These are also examples of the predominant idea
that violence can be eased – or appeased – through cultural intervention
and in the Mexican case, by giving away highly desirable goods.

Aside from this ‘artistic approach’ to social, political and military
action, sensible production has taken up a political function, as
political work has been developed into a matter of codification using
medial forms with the purpose of creating a terrain for political acts,
creating an “activist imaginary” made of political fields constituted by
images. Political action embedded in cultural forms implies making
things public as a way of signs.[^Test-chapter_17] An example could be Trevor
Paglen’s (sometimes abstract or blurry) photographs of top-secret
governmental, nuclear and military sites. Works such as Paglen’s, seek
to make visible the invisible under the premise that such an act is
political. Yet, what images such as Paglen’s represent is vague in
political terms. What I find problematic is that the gap between
*political* representation and *aesthetic* representation is now wider
than ever. Representation means “making the absent present,” which is
always an incomplete task because totality is impossible to convey, and
it works in two senses. As *Vertreten* (or political representation) it
means taking the place of others in order to speak on their behalf, and
as *Darstellen* (or aesthetic representation) it is the form of
representation that implies describing the other in the first person.
Representation was brought into a crisis in the 1960s because it was
accused of hiding the fact that the speaker was occupying the place of
the represented and thus, workers and minorities were prompted to speak
on their behalf and in the first person. Nowadays, however, the gap
between political (*Vertreten*) and aesthetic (*Darstellen*)
representations is wider than ever because whatever political acts
encoded in medial forms may represent, it renders it unstable – partly
because politics have become unrepresentable due to lack of stable
political subjects – as they are collective enunciations constantly
‘becoming.’ In this context, “expressive” politics is valued over
representation because “it embodies rebellious subjectivities expressing
themselves without delegation and they do so through formal and symbolic
richness.”[^Test-chapter_18] One of the issues that rises is that there is lack of a
common ground to universalize the multiplicity of singular struggles and
social movements scattered across the world like archipelagos. There are
just too many images in the Infosphere, and ‘sensible politics’ exists
for and by its own public, which is made up of social movements and
politically minded cultural producers. In this regard, cultural
infrastructure functions as the platform for ‘sensible politics,’ in
which curators, museum directors and board members (sometimes
representing corporate interests) select and contextualize artwork that
presents certain events and social actions thus determining the
boundaries of public thinking.

Aside from its compensatory role, culture (insofar at it is ‘creativity’
and cognitive production), is not only at the center of political
action, but is also embedded in production and consumption processes,
and neoliberalism – in so far as it has thrived in post-fordist
(flexible) forms and conditions of labor – which had taken up the
characteristics of aesthetic production. Signs and nascent meanings,
desires and projections meet in the market because the post-fordist
economy is based on manufacturing experiences, signs and information.
The core of the knowledge economy is creativity and this is why
qualities of aesthetic production have become hegemonic and have
transformed labor and consumption processes as well as aesthetic
experiences. Not only sensations and feelings are being trivialized and
packaged for sale. Disinterestedness (the core of aesthetic experience
as defined by Kant) has also vanished.[^Test-chapter_19] This arises as the result of
aesthetic experience being enslaved for profit, as well as subsumed to
“political” efficiency – in the sense of State and corporate strategic
investment in culture, as well as it was the transformation of political
action into sensible forms – as opposed to action. These tendencies are
a result of what Stephen Shaviro describes as “the ruthless cognition of
aesthetic sensations and feelings”, as they were transformed into data,
exploited forms of labor, which were marketed as fresh experiences,
exciting lifestyle choices, or as socially-responsible cultural
activities. In the political arena, thirty years of neoliberalism have
crushed any confidence that we might have had on the social contract. If
artists used to identify with the proletariat and social struggles
before, nowadays, aesthetic production – which is lacking a reflexive
program in regards to the conditions of its own production – is geared
just toward the supplementing of the entertainment market with
cultivated and knowledgeable new experiences and sensations.
Furthermore, through subsidizing art and cultural projects,
corporations, states and arts patrons put into practice following
principle of the Prince Claus Fund: “There can be no development without
culture, and there can be no cultural development without freedom of
debate.”[^Test-chapter_20] As this quote becomes evermore evident, the public expects
from culture and art rigorous accountability, critical questioning,
democratic access, dialogue and openness as well as equal representation
in the visual regime (and this is posited as the road to development).
In this context, culture is perceived as “a basic need,” as the founding
principle of Prince Claus Fund states. Thus, states, corporations, the
private sector and society attribute to art a decisive political role on
the one hand, as they invest in culture with the purpose of generating
political and economic surplus value. Bearing in mind that the autonomy
of art is always a political matter, could art be politicized beyond its
autonomy as a site for added value?

The condition of possibility of autonomous, committed art under the new
neoliberal world order, is radically different from what we see as the
autonomy of art under modernism (as *l’art pour l’art*) and post-modern
interdisciplinarity. These imply the institutionalization of the
avant-garde and the subsumption of art to the market, bearing in mind
that the emancipatory promises of modernism (criticality, self-design,
creativity) are now located at the center of our everyday lives both via
consumption and production processes. Theodor Adorno’s take on the
autonomy of art in his (1962) essay entitled “Commitment,” can be
helpful here. In this essay, Adorno responds to Jean-Paul Sartre’s
aesthetic manifesto *What is Literature?* and elaborates a theoretical
debate about engaged literature and autonomous art. According to Adorno,
there are two kinds of works of art. On the one hand, there are works
that “are vulgarly assimilated to the existence against which they
protest.”[^Test-chapter_21] These works “are content with being mere fetishes or a
pass-time, and thus degenerate and become de-politicized cultural
merchandise.”[^Test-chapter_22] This de-politicization, for Adorno is in fact, deeply
political – much politically or socially minded contemporary art would
fit into this category. On the other hand, there is *engaged autonomous
ar*t, which, as art, is necessarily detached from reality. Adorno
defines the autonomy of art not in the sense of its strictly formalist
aspect (although like Walter Benjamin, Adorno also vouches for works of
art that are both formally and politically progressive). For Adorno,
autonomous art negates a direct connection to reality. The distance that
autonomous art has from reality, however, is mediated by reality itself:
this means that a work of art cannot come out of the blue – its origin
is a reaction against reality. Adorno, as does Benjamin, draws a
distinction between ‘commitment’ and ‘tendency.’ Committed art does not
bear the intention of generating betterment measures, legislative acts
or practical institutions (like propaganda) or even transmitting a
concrete ideology, but it operates at the level of fundamental
attitudes. For Adorno, autonomous and engaged works of art operate at
the level of abandoning the social contract with reality and “cease to
speak as if they were reporting the facts: this is the moment in which a
work of art makes people’s hair stand up.”[^Test-chapter_23] According to Adorno, the
shock of the unintelligible (or the ambiguous), is able to communicate
more than what is legible and explicit. In that sense, works of art are
autonomous, instead of heteronomous. Heteronomy implies that an artwork
is subject to a different power, a law that is external and foreign to
art and to its formal logic. When it is autonomous, engaged art is
neither subject to empirical reality nor to a correct political
tendency. Art’s autonomy protects it from popularization, from its
adoption by the market and it implies liberating it from any other
external purpose: from being useful. In this manner, an autonomous work
of art does not convey a message nor does it need to convince the public
(or preach to the converted). And although it opposes society,
autonomous art is still part of it.

If the autonomy of modern art implied considering art as a realm
distanced from reality, art’s post-medium condition means that it has
become a niche within reality.[^Test-chapter_24] What is thus at stake in autonomous
art nowadays, would be to posit it as an experience of reality that is
fundamentally foreign and antagonistic to the prevailing reality. If the
autonomy of art should be located in the realm of reproduction as Marina
Vischmidt argues[^Test-chapter_25] – it would oppose the realm of production of the
social, political and economic surplus value, as it would go against
embodying power and the entrepreneurial model of work. Producing
difference, dragging out the laboring conditions hidden within it,
autonomous art would imply mimesis with distancing itself. Beyond being
used as a tool, autonomous art would refuse becoming an instrument
against its own illusions, as well as refusing to become a political
force, or to be subjected to interests foreign to itself or simply
becoming a pleasing commodity. Overcoming self-censorship, it would
cease to participate in the economy of the globalized artworld,
especially in the name of critical practices, political work or social
justice, abandoning its claim to become a progressive social force.[^Test-chapter_26]
Above all, it would work against the power of culture and the culture of
power.
